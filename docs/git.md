## Introduction

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.
- Designed to track changes in files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people.
- Widely used in software development and in any projects involving file management.
- Designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with efficient and without interfering with each other.
- There are many platforms for hosting git repositories such as GitLab and GitHub.

Key Features

    Version control: Keeps a history of changes, allowing your to recert to previous versions.
    Collaborating: Enables teams to work efficiently, even on large and complex projects.
    Branching: Allows to experiment without affecting the main codebase and to work on multiple features simultaneously.
    Speed: Designed for performance even in large projects.
    Distributed nature: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, improving reliability and flexibility.

## Branching Strategies

## Best Practices

- Commit often and with descriptive messages.
- Ensure commit messages are clear, written in English, and start with a capital letter.
- Phrase your commit messages to complete the sentence: "If you apply this commit, it will ..."
- Regularly integrate changes from the main branch into your feature branch to avoid conflicts.
- Push changes only after verifying they are correct and follow the established workflow.
- Keep feature branches focused on a single goal and short-lived.
- Be consistent with the established Git workflow and branching strategy.
- Use .gitignore files to maintain a clean repository.
- Ensure sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or private data is excluded from commits at all times!
- Reach out to teammater if unexpected behaviour or errors occur.

## Visual Studio Code Extensions

VS Code offers a range of extensions that enhance the Git experience, making version control more intuitive and visually engaging:

- **Git Graph**: A Useful extension for viewing your repository's history in a graphical interface. It allows you to visualize branch structures and commit histories with ease.
- **Git History**: Helps you explore and search through the commit history of files and branches. It provides a detailed log of changes, including diffs of what has changed in each commit.
- **Git Blame**: Essential for quickly identifying who made changes to any line of code. It displays author information directly in the editor, allowing you to understand code ownership and history at a glance.
